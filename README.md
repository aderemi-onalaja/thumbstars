# ThumbStars ⭐️

> A simple, fun way to review places with thumbs up or down, turned into a 1–5 star rating.

---

## 💡 Concept

ThumbStars makes reviewing places easy and fast. Instead of writing long reviews or picking star ratings, users tap 👍 or 👎 on specific aspects like Service, Cleanliness, or Value. These votes are combined into a single 1–5 star rating that’s fair and reliable, even with just a few votes. It works with Google Places to show trusted place details and links back to Google for more info.

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. **Find a Place**: Search for a place (e.g., “Joe’s Coffee Shop”) using Google Places.
2. **Vote**: Tap 👍 or 👎 for Service, Cleanliness, Value, etc.
3. **See Ratings**: View the overall star rating (e.g., 3.5★) and per-aspect scores.
4. **Check Google**: Click “See reviews on Google” for more details.

**Example**:
- Joe’s Coffee Shop gets 8👍/2👎 for Service, 3👍/0👎 for Cleanliness, 1👍/1👎 for Value.
- ThumbStars calculates a 3.5★ rating, shown as a star display with “Based on 15 votes.”

## 🛡️ Fairness & Trust

- **One Vote per Person**: Users can vote once per aspect per place.
- **No Spam**: We limit votes and watch for odd patterns to keep things honest.
- **Privacy First**: No personal info stored, just an anonymous user ID.
- **Confidence Labels**: Shows “High confidence” for places with lots of votes, or “Early rating” for new ones.
