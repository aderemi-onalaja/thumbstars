## Key Steps Explained
1. **Search for a Place**: Users type a place name (e.g., “Joe’s Coffee Shop”). Google Places API autocompletes with verified names and addresses.
2. **Select a Place**: User picks a place, loading its Place Card.
3. **View Place Card**: Shows place name, address, star rating (e.g., 3.5★), and a link to Google’s official page.
4. **See Criteria**: Displays chips like “Service: 71% 👍”, “Cleanliness: 71% 👍”, “Value: 50% 👍” with thumbs for voting.
5. **Vote**: User taps 👍 or 👎 for each criterion. Animations show immediate feedback (e.g., chip highlights).
6. **Submit Vote**: Vote is sent to the API with a `user_token`, hashed to `user_hash` for privacy and spam prevention.
7. **Update Aggregate**: Backend recalculates per-criterion scores and overall stars using Bayesian smoothing.
8. **Refresh Place Card**: Updated stars and vote count (e.g., “Based on 137 votes”) are shown.
9. **Optional Google Link**: User can click “See reviews on Google” to view the place’s Google profile.
10. **End**: User sees the updated rating or searches for another place.

## Why It’s Great

- **Visual Feedback**: Animations and real-time updates keep users engaged.
- **Trusted Integration**: Google Places API ensures accurate place data and compliance.
